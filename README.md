# Getting started

<br>

## Step 1

<br>

- Launch your SQL and Apache server from any working AMP application, eg. MAMP, XAMP. WAMP, etc.

<br>

## Step 2

<br>

- Import the database from the dependencies folder and configure it where needed

<br>

## Step 3

<br>

<p>
    It is recommended to serve the application on localhost:9000 due to the images being <br>
    stored on the application itself and being referenced from out of the database.
</p>

<code>
    php -S localhost:9000
</code>

<br>

# Usage

<br>

<p>
    You will be welcomed with a home page and a responsive navbar. From here you can explore <br>
    around, but to be able to add items to your cart and view them you will have to create an <br>
    account and login. From here you can browse through the application. Enjoy!
